# A Tour
Hello, welcome to my GitHub page!! Now you might be thinking, WTF is going on here? Well, if you do visit my GitHub you will see a quite number of repositories and you might get confused, so I'm here to help you out:D
Here is a list of categories my repositories fit into:
* [Artificial Intelligence and ML](#ai)
* [Data Science and Data Analysis]()
* [Web development]()
* [App development]()
* [Compiler]()
* [Animations and Visualizations]()
* [Courses and School]()
* [Super simple projects I added here because I didn't know where else to put them (What? I have a mac, 250 GB is so not enough!!)]()
